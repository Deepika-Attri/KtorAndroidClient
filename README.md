# KtorAndroidClient
Developed a news app using Ktor and Jetpack Compose involves using Ktor's tools to connect to a news API and fetch articles. With Ktor's HTTP client, you can pull in news data from an external source. Once fetched, Jetpack Compose helps build the app's user interface, displaying the news articles in a structured layout.
